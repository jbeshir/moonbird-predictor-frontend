A simple probability-combining service using machine learning. Uses predictions from PredictionBook as a source of training data and samples, and Google ML Engine to automatically retrain and run the model. Runs on App Engine.

You can see this in action at https://predictor.moonbird.io

https://github.com/jbeshir/moonbird-predictor-keras provides the actual model and training script. 

https://github.com/jbeshir/predictionbook-extractor provides the package used for retrieving data from PredictionBook.
